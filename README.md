-How to install:
  Simply copy the folder MorgHUD to your custom folder
  on "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom"

-How to use the Gunplay version:
	Go to the resource folder and change the name of clientscheme.res to clientscheme_smooth.res
	and clientscheme_gunplay.res to clientscheme.res

-How to use the custom crosshairs included (you can activate more than one):
  Open the file hudlayout.res inside the scripts folder with a text editor (e.g. Windows Notepad)
  search the on you want and change the values visible and enabled to 1, so it looks like this:
	
	"visible"	"1"
	"enabled"	"1"

Thanks
